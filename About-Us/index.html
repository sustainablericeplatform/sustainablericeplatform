        <p>The Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP) promotes resource-use efficiency and sustainability in the global rice sector through an alliance that links research, production, policy making, trade and consumption. It bridges institutional members across regions and sectors to find local solutions for rice smallholders that will help improve yield, reduce costs and protect the environment.</p>
        <p>The SRP aims to encourage one million farmers to adopt climate-smart sustainable best practices in five years (2016-2020), as an active response to the global call to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all, as set out in the UN Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
