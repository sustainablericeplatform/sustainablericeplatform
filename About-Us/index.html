        <p>The Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP) is a multi-stakeholder platform established in December 2011. SRP was co-convened by the UN Environment (UNEP) and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) to promote resource efficiency and sustainability in trade flows, production and consumption operations, and supply chains in the global rice sector.</p>
<p>The SRP pursues public policy development and voluntary market transformation initiatives to provide private, non-profit and public actors in the global rice sector with sustainable production standards and outreach mechanisms that contribute to increasing the global supply of affordable rice, improved livelihoods for rice producers and reduced environmental impact of rice production.</p>
