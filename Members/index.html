                 <!--<p><strong>Share your opinion during the 60-day public consultation to revise the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP) Standard.</strong></p>
                <p>Period: 15 September to 15 November</p>
                <p>The Sustainable Rice Platform Standard for Sustainable Rice Cultivation (SRP Standard) applies to rice production, including post harvest processes, which are still in control of the farmer. Individual farmers, smallholder groups, or larger farms can apply the SRP Standard.</p>
<p>The revision process is intended as a review of the SRP Standard version 1.0 (October 2015), with focus on improving the wording of the existing Standard to ensure consistency and clarity. The SRP Standard version 1.0 comprises 46 requirements grouped under eight themes, each aimed at achieving a specific sustainability impact.</p>
<p>Following its launch, SRP members in several countries have implemented the SRP Standard at pilot scale and on different farm types, resulting in suggestions for revisions. Public stakeholder input is sought to identify additional areas for potential revision.</p>
                <p>SRP members and non-members may send their comments and/or suggestions through any of the following channels:</p>

                <p><strong>SRP Performance Indicators Revision</strong></p>
                <p>Period: 12 November to 11 December</p>
                <p>The Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP) Performance Indicators was launched in 2015, together with the SRP Standard for Sustainable Rice Cultivation. The 12 indicators are designed to support the Standard by measuring changes resulting from adoption of on-farm sustainable best practice, such as through compliance with the SRP Standard, or other interventions of interest to SRP members.</p>
                <p>This tool is now undergoing revision, in line with the protocol provided by ISEAL. The revision process is intended as a review of the revised SRP Performance Indicators version 1.6 (November 2018), which was prepared by IRRI, with an aim of proposing new levels and areas of measuring data.</p>

                <p><strong>The SRP Bangkok Declaration for Sustainable Rice</strong></p>
                <p>Period: 05 October to 31 December</p>
                <p>The First Global Sustainable Rice Conference and Exhibition was co-convened by UN Environment and the International Rice Research Institute under the auspices of the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP). The conference brought together over 300 stakeholders from 30 countries, representing a broad spectrum of rice sector actors and development professionals, including senior-level representatives from UN and international agencies, governments, private sector supply chain actors, research institutions, farmer groups, equipment and service providers and civil society organizations from around the world.</p>
                <p>The conference aimed to raised awareness of the critical role of rice in food security, poverty alleviation and climate change in the coming 25 years, to understand the sustainability challenges implicit in covering a projected 25% shortfall in global production by 2050, and to update participants on proven innovative solutions.</p>
                <p>A key outcome of the conference is the <strong>SRP Bangkok Declaration on Sustainable Rice</strong>, which calls for collective multi-stakeholder action at local, regional and global levels to foster adoption of climate-smart sustainable best practices to enhance long-term productivity of rice landscapes despite a shrinking resource base, while protecting the environment, mitigating climate change impacts and safeguarding smallholder livelihoods and gender rights.</p>   
                <p>The recommendations articulated herein will be further communicated to a wider stakeholder community as a contribution to the forthcoming COP23 climate change talks in Bonn, Germany (6-17 November 2017) as well as to meeting our collective obligations under the 2030 Agenda and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.</p>

                    <p>Venue: International Rice Research Institute, Los Banos, Philippines</p>
                    <p>One of the SRP’s key commitments is to provide training programs to accompany the deployment of the Standard and Performance Indicators. Since its launch in 2015, members have expressed interest in implementing relevant trainings to cater for the needs of their respective networks and stakeholders. As multi-country field pilots were implemented in 2016, the Sustainable Rice Platform has already conducted a number of training workshops, with support from IRRI. However, as training needs are increasing and becoming more differentiated, it will be crucial to develop a coherent framework for SRP-related training at all levels.</p>
                    <p>This workshop brings together representatives of interested Sustainable Rice Platform members, many of whom have significant training capacity, to discuss needs and plan such a framework, bearing in mind technical, geographical and other complementarities in drafting a collaborative action plan. The workshop is organized by Peter Sprang, SRP’s Technical Coordinator, together with experts from IRRI, and hosted by IRRI at its headquarters in Los Baños, Philippines.</p>
