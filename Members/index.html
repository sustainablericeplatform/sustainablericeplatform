                    <p>Dear SRP members,</p>
                    <p>I am pleased to welcome you to the Members’ Area – where you may find essential organizational materials, with some that are exclusively available for SRP members only.</p>
                    <p>I hope that these materials can support you in strengthening your own sustainability initiatives, and consequently allow you contribute to the overall goal of encouraging one million farmers to adopt climate-smart sustainable best practices by 2021.</p>
                    <p>On behalf of the SRP Advisory Committee, I would like to thank you for your continuing commitment to supporting SRP’s mission of promoting resource-use efficiency and sustainability in the global rice sector.</p>
                    <p>Together, let us continue working towards a sustainable future for rice, while protecting the environment, mitigating climate change impacts and safeguarding smallholder livelihoods.</p>

                    <p>Venue: International Rice Research Institute, Los Banos, Philippines</p>
                    <p>One of the Sustainable Rice Platform’s key commitments is to provide training programs to accompany the deployment of the Standard and Performance Indicators. Since its launch in 2015, members have expressed great interest in implementing relevant trainings for their respective network and stakeholders. As multi-country pilot field implementations rolled-out in 2016, several trainings have already taken place with minimal intervention from the Sustainable Rice Platform. To ensure the quality and consistency of project outputs, it is crucial to develop a coherent framework for SRP-related trainings. Peter Sprang, Sustainable Rice Platform’s Technical Coordinator together with experts from the International Rice Research Institute will organize and facilitate the forthcoming Sustainable Rice Platform Training Strategy Workshop.</p>
