                    <p>Dear SRP members,</p>
                    <p>I am pleased to welcome you to the Members’ Area – where you may find essential organizational materials, with some that are exclusively available for SRP members only.</p>
                    <p>I hope that these materials can support you in strengthening your own sustainability initiatives, and consequently allow you contribute to the overall goal of encouraging one million farmers to adopt climate-smart sustainable best practices by 2021.</p>
                    <p>On behalf of the SRP Advisory Committee, I would like to thank you for your continuing commitment to supporting SRP’s mission of promoting resource-use efficiency and sustainability in the global rice sector.</p>
                    <p>Together, let us continue working towards a sustainable future for rice, while protecting the environment, mitigating climate change impacts and safeguarding smallholder livelihoods.</p>
