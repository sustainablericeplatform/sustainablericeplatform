                    <p>I am pleased to welcome you to the Members’ Area – where you may find essential organizational materials, with some that are exclusively available for Sustainable Rice Platform members.</p>

                    <p>Venue: International Rice Research Institute, Los Banos, Philippines</p>
                    <p>One of the SRP’s key commitments is to provide training programs to accompany the deployment of the Standard and Performance Indicators. Since its launch in 2015, members have expressed interest in implementing relevant trainings to cater for the needs of their respective networks and stakeholders. As multi-country field pilots were implemented in 2016, the Sustainable Rice Platform has already conducted a number of training workshops, with support from IRRI. However, as training needs are increasing and becoming more differentiated, it will be crucial to develop a coherent framework for SRP-related training at all levels.</p>
                    <p>This workshop brings together representatives of interested Sustainable Rice Platform members, many of whom have significant training capacity, to discuss needs and plan such a framework, bearing in mind technical, geographical and other complementarities in drafting a collaborative action plan. The workshop is organized by Peter Sprang, SRP’s Technical Coordinator, together with experts from IRRI, and hosted by IRRI at its headquarters in Los Baños, Philippines.</p>
