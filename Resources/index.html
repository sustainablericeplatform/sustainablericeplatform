            <p>Sustainable Rice Production in Thailand</p>
            <p>Thailand’s Rice Department, GIZ, OLAM, Bayer and UTZ have jointly conducted a pilot implementation of the SRP Sustainable Rice Cultivation Standard with two rice farmer groups in Ubon Ratchathani province in late 2016. The pilot testing of the SRP Standard in Thailand was also considered as one of interventions by the Better Rice Initiative Asia (BRIA) to improve market access for resource-poor rice farmers in this area.</p>
            <p>Farmers were encouraged to improve the sustainable rice cultivation practices to produce better product on safety and quality aspects, with the suitable and effective input application, yet better environmental friendly practices. The good product quality has also increased the market access with better selling price.</p>
            <p>The pilot also explored various assurance systems on the standard implementation, which covered three main aspects: First, using the SRP Standard, farmers learn to implement & adopt sustainable practices, and implement a farm management system which consisted of, among others, a farm diary. Then, working in collaborative groups – the farmer groups were trained to implement an Internal Management System, which is a structured approach on how to collect data, keep records and identify additional training needs. Finally, the farmer groups were audited against the SRP Standard by the independent Certification Body OneCert. For this UTZ trained auditors from OneCert, who were also accompanied by UTZ assurance experts on their first field visit to see how they interpreted the Standard and assessed the farmer groups.</p>
            <p>OneCert assessed that the farmers’ compliance levels to the SRP Standard averaged 84%. The pilot is expected to be extended to more farmer groups in 2017. The development of the SRP standard was funded by GIZ and Olam, with support from UTZ.</li>
