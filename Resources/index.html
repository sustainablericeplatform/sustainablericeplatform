<p>Thailand’s Rice Department, GIZ, OLAM and UTZ have jointly conducted a pilot implementation of the SRP Sustainable Rice Cultivation Standard with two rice farmer groups in Ubon Ratchathani province in late 2016. This activity was also considered as one of Better Rice Initiative Asia’s (BRIA) interventions to improve market access for resource-poor rice farmers in selected areas.</p>
<p>The collaborative project commenced with an orientation for participating farmers, followed by a full training programme. Three months after it was launched, an external audit was conducted to verify compliance of the farmers with the SRP Standard, revealing an impressive 84% farmer compliance. The independent third party assessment was conducted by OneCert auditors, who were trained and accompanied by assurance experts from UTZ.</p>
<p>During the pilot implementation phase, Olam International played an active role in facilitating liquidity for participating farmers. The company engaged a major local miller who agreed to buy the entire production from the farmers at the most competitive price. This arrangement guaranteed a better price for participating farmers as it simplified the value chain by avoiding brokers and other middle-men. By the end of the pilot phase of the project, a total of 400 tonnes of rice had been produced.</p>
<p>The success of the activity can be attributed to the strong commitment and contributions by participating organizations from different sectors. It is expected that the pilot will be extended to more farmer groups in the coming years.</p>
