                <p><strong>Oxfam reviews sustainable rice standards</strong></p>
                <p>A recent Oxfam-commissioned review of key rice sustainability standards and schemes assessed the rigour of ten existing initiatives for rice smallholders across nine key themes: producer group management, farm business management, nutrient and pest management, water management, harvest and post-harvest practices, landscape management, health and safety, labor rights, and community development.</p>
                <p>The research report: Implications of Sustainable Rice Production Standards and Initiatives For Small-Scale Rice Producers also reviewed the inclusiveness and effectiveness of ten company and development initiatives in supporting small-scale producers, including the Better Rice Initiative (BRIA), the Closing Rice Yield Gaps in Asia with Reduced Environmental Footprints (CORIGAP) Project, and the Rice Partners Ltd. Programme in Pakistan under the SDC-funded Water Productivity Project (WAPRO).</p>
                <p>According to the report, the SRP Standard most consistently covers most of the 9 themes reviewed. In particular the SRP was recognized as having a high level of rigour in the areas of farm preparation, harvest and post-harvest practices, and water management, and the highest level of rigour in relation to climate change mitigation.</p>

                <p><strong>SRP Performance Indicators Revision</strong></p>
                <p>Period: 12 November to 11 December</p>
                <p>The Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP) Performance Indicators was launched in 2015, together with the SRP Standard for Sustainable Rice Cultivation. The 12 indicators are designed to support the Standard by measuring changes resulting from adoption of on-farm sustainable best practice, such as through compliance with the SRP Standard, or other interventions of interest to SRP members.</p>
                <p>This tool is now undergoing revision, in line with the protocol provided by ISEAL. The revision process is intended as a review of the revised <a href="/assets/docs/SRP Performance Indicators v. 1.6 for public consultation.docx" target="_blank"> SRP Performance Indicators version 1.6 (November 2018)</a>, which was prepared by IRRI, with an aim of proposing new levels and areas of measuring data.</p>
                <pShare your opinion during the 30-day public consultation to revise the SRP Performance Indicators. Download the comment submission form and send us your feedback by 11 December 2018.</p>

                <p><strong>Participate in a 30-day public consultation on SRP Assurance Scheme</strong></p>
                <p>Following approval of the SRP Assurance Scheme by the SRP Executive Board, the document has been further improved and is now available for an online public consultation for a 30-day period. Anchored on the SRP Standard for Sustainable Rice Cultivation v 2.1, the scheme offers partners a flexible, cost-effective basis for verifiable sustainability claims for rice produced using proven, climate-smart sustainable best practices.</p>
                <p>The SRP Assurance Scheme defines the rules for actors engaged in measuring compliance or demonstrating improvements, and the use of SRP trademarks (claims or seals). It focuses on  verification, and is built on a strong internal assessment. The Assurance Scheme offers registration and self-assessment as a starting point. It encourages innovative remote/landscape assessments, participatory schemes, individual producer assessments and producer group schemes through Internal Management Systems.</p>
                <p>To maximize the robustness, transparency and cost-effectiveness of the Scheme, members and non-members are warmly invited to provide your feedback and suggestions by participating in an online public consultation from today (23 March) to 22 April 2020. Submit your feedback to laspinas@un.org using the Comments Submission Form below.</p>

                <p><strong>4-5 October 2017, Bangkok - First Global Sustainable Rice Conference and Exhibition</strong></p>
                <p>The First Global Sustainable Rice Conference and Exhibition was co-convened by UN Environment and the International Rice Research Institute under the auspices of the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP). The conference brought together over 300 stakeholders from 30 countries, representing a broad spectrum of rice sector actors and development professionals, including senior-level representatives from UN and international agencies, governments, private sector supply chain actors, research institutions, farmer groups, equipment and service providers and civil society organizations from around the world.</p>
                <!--<p>The conference aimed to raise awareness of the critical role of rice in food security, poverty alleviation and climate change in the coming 25 years, to understand the sustainability challenges implicit in covering a projected 25% shortfall in global production by 2050, and to update participants on proven innovative solutions.</p>
                <p>A key outcome of the conference is the <strong>SRP Bangkok Declaration on Sustainable Rice</strong>, which calls for collective multi-stakeholder action at local, regional and global levels to foster adoption of climate-smart sustainable best practices to enhance long-term productivity of rice landscapes despite a shrinking resource base, while protecting the environment, mitigating climate change impacts and safeguarding smallholder livelihoods and gender rights.</p>   
                <p>The recommendations articulated herein will be further communicated to a wider stakeholder community as a contribution to the forthcoming COP23 climate change talks in Bonn, Germany (6-17 November 2017) as well as to meeting our collective obligations under the 2030 Agenda and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
