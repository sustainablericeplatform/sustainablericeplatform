                <h2 class="green">Important Annoucement</h2>
                <p><strong>Share your opinion during the 60-day public consultation to revise the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP) Standard.</strong></p>
                <p>Period: 15 September to 15 November</p>
                <p>The Sustainable Rice Platform Standard for Sustainable Rice Cultivation (SRP Standard) applies to rice production, including post harvest processes, which are still in control of the farmer. Individual farmers, smallholder groups, or larger farms can apply the SRP Standard.</p>
<p>The revision process is intended as a review of the SRP Standard version 1.0 (October 2015), with focus on improving the wording of the existing Standard to ensure consistency and clarity. The SRP Standard version 1.0 comprises 46 requirements grouped under eight themes, each aimed at achieving a specific sustainability impact.</p>
<p>Following its launch, SRP members in several countries have implemented the SRP Standard at pilot scale and on different farm types, resulting in suggestions for revisions. Public stakeholder input is sought to identify additional areas for potential revision.</p>
                <p>SRP members and non-members may send their comments and/or suggestions through any of the following channels:</p>
