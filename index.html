                <p><strong>Oxfam reviews sustainable rice standards</strong></p>
                <p>A recent Oxfam-commissioned review of key rice sustainability standards and schemes assessed the rigour of ten existing initiatives for rice smallholders across nine key themes: producer group management, farm business management, nutrient and pest management, water management, harvest and post-harvest practices, landscape management, health and safety, labor rights, and community development.</p>
                <p>The research report: Implications of Sustainable Rice Production Standards and Initiatives For Small-Scale Rice Producers also reviewed the inclusiveness and effectiveness of ten company and development initiatives in supporting small-scale producers, including the Better Rice Initiative (BRIA), the Closing Rice Yield Gaps in Asia with Reduced Environmental Footprints (CORIGAP) Project, and the Rice Partners Ltd. Programme in Pakistan under the SDC-funded Water Productivity Project (WAPRO).</p>
                <p>According to the report, the SRP Standard most consistently covers most of the 9 themes reviewed. In particular the SRP was recognized as having a high level of rigour in the areas of farm preparation, harvest and post-harvest practices, and water management, and the highest level of rigour in relation to climate change mitigation.</p>

                <p>Every grain counts: what every rice consumer must know.</p>
                <p>The message is clear, which likely rings true to both a rice producer and consumer: every grain counts.</p>
                <p>As three volunteer students from NIST International School in Bangkok delved into the rice sustainability sector, they discovered that rice sustainability is a chain of interconnected issues, which consumers need to be aware of.</p>
                <p>Through a collaboration between GIZ and the Sustainable Rice Platform, and with the participation of the Thai Rice Department, let us follow Hannah, Paul and Oki into the fields and hear their story.</p>

                <p><strong>SRP Standard and Performance Indicators Revision</strong></p>
                <p>The Sustainable Rice Platform Standard for Sustainable Rice Cultivation and Performance Indicators were launched in 2015 and have since undergone field implementation in a number of key rice-growing countries. As a result of feedback from farmers and users in the field, these tools are now undergoing revision, in compliance with the protocol provided by ISEAL.</p>
                <p>The revision process is intended as a review of version 1.0 (October 2015), with focus on improving the wording of the existing tool. The SRP Standard version 1.0 comprises 46 requirements grouped under eight themes, each aimed at achieving a specific sustainability impact.</p>
                <p>An open public consultation was initiated from 15 September to 15 November 2017 to improve the consistency, clarity and utility of the SRP Standard.</p>
                <p>Following the close of the public consultation period, feedback will be incorporated in consultation with an expert panel. We will make available a synopsis of how comments were addressed, and prepare a final draft of the revised SRP Standard for Advisory Committee approval in March 2018.</p>
                <p>The review and revision of the SRP Standard and Performance Indicators is a priority activity led by Sandra Khananusit and Working Group 3: Farmer Support, Performance Assessment and Assurance. A parallel consultation led by IRRI to revise the Sustainable Rice Platform Performance Indicators will be announced soon.</p>
                <p>In the interim, the SRP Standard and Performance Indicators version 1.0 remain effective at this time. A transition period and date on which the revised tools shall become effective, will be announced in due course.</p>

                <p><strong>4-5 October 2017, Bangkok - First Global Sustainable Rice Conference and Exhibition</strong></p>
                <p>The First Global Sustainable Rice Conference and Exhibition was co-convened by UN Environment and the International Rice Research Institute under the auspices of the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP). The conference brought together over 300 stakeholders from 30 countries, representing a broad spectrum of rice sector actors and development professionals, including senior-level representatives from UN and international agencies, governments, private sector supply chain actors, research institutions, farmer groups, equipment and service providers and civil society organizations from around the world.</p>
                <!--<p>The conference aimed to raise awareness of the critical role of rice in food security, poverty alleviation and climate change in the coming 25 years, to understand the sustainability challenges implicit in covering a projected 25% shortfall in global production by 2050, and to update participants on proven innovative solutions.</p>
                <p>A key outcome of the conference is the <strong>SRP Bangkok Declaration on Sustainable Rice</strong>, which calls for collective multi-stakeholder action at local, regional and global levels to foster adoption of climate-smart sustainable best practices to enhance long-term productivity of rice landscapes despite a shrinking resource base, while protecting the environment, mitigating climate change impacts and safeguarding smallholder livelihoods and gender rights.</p>   
                <p>The recommendations articulated herein will be further communicated to a wider stakeholder community as a contribution to the forthcoming COP23 climate change talks in Bonn, Germany (6-17 November 2017) as well as to meeting our collective obligations under the 2030 Agenda and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
